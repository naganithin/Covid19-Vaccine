  <h1>Covid19 Vaccine Supply chain</h1>
</div>

# Motive

Due to a lack of appropriate supply chain management and best practices, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed weak areas in the vaccine process. Due to high demand and cost, many countries are still unable to take holidays. Even after making significant efforts on vaccination, many holidays are wasted owing to poor vaccination center management.
We’ve created a DApp to
showcase the system’s functionality. The DApp links two separate
blockchains, one for internal (intra) usage and worldwide (inter)
use. We discovered that the suggested system could deliver digital
records integrity, availability, and system scalability based on
the system analysis.

# Working:

Vaccines start from vaccine Manufacturing Companies(VMC) which are given order by government drug control agency(GDAC).
They come to Hospital authorities(HA) and distribute to Local authorities(LA).

All the information is stored in Blockchain using Smart contracts. They are connected using Web3 for front end interaction.
